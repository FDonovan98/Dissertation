    Games industry has lots of wasted work. \emph{Define wasted work}. Attempt to see if adoptions of agile methodologies can help reduce this amount. Tracking what methodologies teams adopt alongside the amount of wasted work, both as individual assets and in terms of wasted time.
\end{abstract}

\section{Introduction}
    What is agile? What methodologies will I be looking at? Why these? Explain more about what is wasted work.

\section{Background \& Supporting Literature}
    Go into a level of detail about each agile method I'll be looking at

\section{Research Question}
    From the above sources, I have formed \textbf{The actual question}
    \subsection{hypothesis \& null hypothesis}

\section{Artifact}
    \subsection{What will be made}
        Artifact to track wasted work
        track number of assets that have been wasted, as well as overall wasted time
        Extension: Integration with task tracking software to automate this as much as I can

    \subsection{How will I ensure Quality}
        Quality control. Roadmap? Unit Testing? Integration testing?

    \subsection{How will I create it}

    \subsection{Why will this answer the questions}

\section{Research Methodology}
    \subsection{Experimental Design}

    \subsection{Limitations}
        Time, resources

    \subsection{Sampling Plan}
        Sample size, sampling method

    \subsection{Data management plan}
        Managing, collecting, \& storing data

    \subsection{Data Analysis}

    \subsection{Ethical Considerations}

\section{Appendix}
    Data analysis code, supporting screenshots, list of unit tests \& testing plan \cite{steamVid}
