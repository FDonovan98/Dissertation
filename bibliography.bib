  abstract  = { Continuous delivery is a set of practices and principles to release software faster and more frequently. While it helps to bridge the gap between developers and operations for software in production, it can also improve the communication between developers and customers in the development phase, i.e. before software is in production. It shortens the feedback cycle and developers ideally use it right from the beginning of a software development project. In this paper we describe the implementation of a customized continuous delivery workflow and its benefits in a multi-customer project course in summer 2013. Our workflow focuses on the ability to deliver software with only a few clicks to the customer in order to obtain feedback as early as possible. This helps developers to validate their understanding about requirements, which is especially helpful in agile projects where requirements might change often. We describe how we integrated this workflow and the role of the release manager into our project-based organization and how we introduced it using different teaching methods. Within three months 90 students worked in 10 different projects with real customers from industry and delivered 490 releases. After the project course we evaluated our approach in an online questionnaire and in personal interviews. Our findings and observations show that participating students understood and applied the concepts and are convinced about the benefits of continuous delivery. },

  abstract  = {In this paper we describe Tornado, which we teach in our software engineering project courses. Tornado is a new process model that combines the Unified Process with Scrum elements.The Tornado model focuses on scenario-based design starting with visionary scenarios funneling down to demo scenarios. Tornado offers models for a broad range of activities. In addition to formal models used for analysis and design, Tornado encourages the developer to use informal models as communication medium for the interaction with the customer and end user. These communication models can be used as the basis of early releases to increase the feedback from customer to developer. We argue that the combination of informal modeling and release management can be introduced early in software engineering project courses.We describe a case study in which we demonstrate the use of communication models and release management in a multi-customer course with 80 students. In three months, the students produced 163 releases for 11 customers.},
