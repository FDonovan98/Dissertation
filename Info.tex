    \section{Introduction}
        Hello, I am Frost Donovan, a third year Computing For Games student who has been a Producer throughout my group projects. I can be contacted at \textbf{FrostBDonovan@gmail.com}. The supervisor for this research is Dr Michael Scott, who can be contacted at \textbf{michael.scott@falmouth.ac.uk}.
        The purpose of this dissertation is to investigate the effect of a Continuous Delivery pipeline can have upon student game development teams. In industry, these pipelines are used to increase the consistency of available builds, as well as the quality and reliability of those builds. 

        Potential benefits for participating in this research are:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item A game build that is automatically produced every night and is then available to be downloaded. This will be built from your main branch on Git.
            \item This allows an up-to-date build to always be accessible, as well as making it easy to download historic builds.
            \item This will also flag any errors that would prevent a build being made, or any problems that would cause any unit tests to fail. 
        \end{itemize}

    \section{Commitment \& risk}
        Participants will be required to fill out a short, 7 question form every two weeks.
        The entire team will need to consent to this tool being run in order for a team to be eligible, although only a \textit{majority} of the team members will need to commit to filling out the survey every two weeks. Ideally, every member of the team would fill out the survey. 
        \\ \\
        A team's academic supervisor will also be required to fill out a short form every two weeks, so they will also need to consent \& commit to this.
        \\ \\
        There will also be a short, free form interview at the conclusion of the research.
