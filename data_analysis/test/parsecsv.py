# - script to parse student data as this only does supervisor sheet
# - student sheet will need to be related to a supervisor before encoding
# - dictionary of all supervisor email's
# - NONONO way overcomplicating it
# - just include a field on each survey to select the team & hash with that. so much simpler
# - will also need to map groups to if they are experimental or not and include that as a column
